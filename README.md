# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard

Name of Application: WeatherDaily

My Task: As a busy traveler, I need to develope an application to see the
weather for multiple cities to that proper arrangement can be made.


# Application Requirement:

 - Application must have a functional dashboard with functioning inputs
 - User must be presented with current and future conditions for that city
 - City Data must be added to the search history.
 - Data must display city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the 
   temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
 - UV Index must be presented with unique color that indicates whether the 
   conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
 - Future weather conditions for that citiy must present  5-day forecast that 
   displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the 
   temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
 - Click action on city search history must again present current and future
   condition for that city.
